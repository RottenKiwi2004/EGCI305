# Random Variables

## Random Variables and Probability

### Sample Spaces

- Discrete / Continuous

### Events (E)

Subset of sample space of random experiment

### Counting Techniques
- Multiplication Rule
  
  $k$ steps, each step $n_i$ choices
  $$\prod_{i=1}^{k} n_i$$
- Permutation Rule
    
    Number of ways $S$ of size $n$ can be arranged

    $$n!$$

  - Subset Permutations
    
    Sequence only $r$ items from set of $n$ items

    $$P_r^n = \frac{n!}{(n-r!)}$$
    
  - Similar Permutations

    Count sequences when not all items are different.

    $$\frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!\dots n_r!}$$

- Combination Rule
  
    Selection or $r$ items from a set, `order doesn't matter`

    $$C_r^n = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r!)}$$

### Probability
- Chance of event
- [0, 1] interval
- $P(E)$ = sum of probabilities of outcomes in $E$

## Discrete Random Variables

### Random Variables `(rv)`
- `rv` denoted by $X$
- Value denoted by $x$
- Example: $P(X=x)$

### Con

### Conditional Probability Distributions
